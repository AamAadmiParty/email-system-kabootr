-- SUMMARY --

The feeds module gives you the options to import the users using feeds.But when
you try to import users and in your improting file(e.g. CSV) there is no column
for username then feeds module gives you error on importing.

Here the Feeds Email Registration module allows you to extract username from 
Email while using feeds to import users.There should be a column for email 
in the file which you are using to import users and While mapping Email
must be mapped to username.
